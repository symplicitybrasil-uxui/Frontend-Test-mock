# Front-end Test
The purpose of this test is simple: *we want to see the best you can do*. Because of that, the requirements described here
are only *desired*. We expect you to follow the guidelines, but don't worry about delivering a fully functional app. We would like you to share with us every piece of work you may produce, we appreciate it.

So, here's the deal. As your clients, we want an app to:
 * See a list with all characters from Ricky and Morty TV show based on https://rickandmortyapi.com/ data;
 * Check the details about an specific character;
 * Use on both mobile and desktop environment;
 * Be usable in multiple browsers (e.g. Safari, Chrome, IE);

Even though it's not mandatory, we would be happy to see:
 * a filter for characters based on some data type;
 * a functional search box to look up characters by name;
 
To help you out, we got our designers to create this mockup so you can focus on your code quality.

Last but not least, we also would be happy if:
 * **You stick to the mock**;
 * You use **`plain CSS/SCSS`** (No layout library like Bootstrap or Foundation);
 * Your app behave like a **`Single Page Application`**;

And that's your test. 

At the end of the due date, please, *submit your code in your github account and add the README.md document* with the instructions to run your project whether it's deployed in some place (e.g. Heroku) or to build it locally in our machines. 

If you have any doubts about the test, suit yourself and get in touch with us on **uxui@symplicity.com**.

Good luck!

P.S.: You may keep this project at your github profile as part of your portfolio.
