# Front-end Test

## What should you do?

Build a responsive app that:
* Makes **`REST`** requests to Rick and Morty API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/;
* Has a homepage with all **`Characters`**;
* Has a search box which allows users to search **`an specific Character`**;
* When clicking on a Character it must **`show details`** about him/her/it;
* Has a **`filter option`** based on any data type you want (e.g.: species, gender, status);
    
We want you to develop the app based on the following mocks: 
- MOCK SHOW DE BOLA DESKTOP
- MOCK SHOW DE BOLA MOBILE

## Technical Requirements

- **`You must follow the mocks`**;
- You must use **`plain CSS/SCSS`** (No layout library);
- Your app must work on **`all browsers (cross-browser)`**;
- Your app must behave like a **`Single Page Application`**;

BE AWESOME AND CREATIVE! Don't limit yourself  to the requirements only! BE A JEDI ON CODE. Don't be a bitch.
